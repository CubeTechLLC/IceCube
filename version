#Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

#    MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
#    MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
#    PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

#Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
#Quoted from semver.org

#This is a modified semantic versioning number. The modified part comes from the -nightly###### in the nightly builds,
#but that is only to prevent manually changing the version every time for nightlies and otherwise very unstable code.
#This version number was designed to be used in wercker.yml, but can be read by execution in bash offline or other ways.
